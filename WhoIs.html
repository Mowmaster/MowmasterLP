	<h3>History of Mowmaster</h3>
	<h4>2011</h4>
	<p>I, Mowmaster started playing <span>Minecraft</span> on the tablet.<br /> Pocket eddition, which i had found through an article posted on the Nvision app
	in the fall of 2011.Of course as updates came out I became courious about the features and eventually found myself on the <span>minecraft</span> forums
	 looking at the changelogs posted there. That took me into starting to watch LP'ers like Vintage beef, W92Baj and Guude Boulderfist. After 
	 some time i realized that the game they played and mine were very differnt. This caused me to go out and find what other "Minecrafts" there 
	 were out there.</p>
	 <h4>2012</h4>
	 <p>Twords the end of the semester in 2012 I Finally bought <span>minecraft</span> for 1.4.7 and started to play in singleplayer.<br /> Watching more starter 
	 videos on youtube helped my understanding of basic redstone farms. After all singleplayer is a little dull in vanilla so after some time
	 i started seeking out multiplayer servers to play on. Mineguild is the one i started playing on and building my "Skybase" It wasnt till 
	 the end of summer that i started my first server on creeperhost.net. The fall of 2012 when fist FTB pack was being released I started playing 
	 Modded <span>minecraft</span></p>
	 <h4>2013</h4>
	 <p>At the start of the year in 2013 Mine Creeper server was started, We played Mindcrack FTB and later on Ultimate FTB for <span>minecraft</span> 1.4.7 <br />
	 After The group got tired of modded we decided to play vanilla 1.5.2 in the summer. But being a modded group we used bukkit and some intresting plugins
	 even attempting a UHC of sorts with some differnt things(It didnt go well,lol) As <span>minecraft</span> started to update nce again we prepared for a world reset
	The server turned creative for a few days and we all started to plan out how things would look in our new world of horses!</p>
	<h4>2014</h4>
	<p>With the dawn of a new year, 2014 we opened up applications again and starter to play the first of many modpacks created by me, Mowmaster.<br />
	these modpacks were private server plays only, and were full of tech, magic, and adventure! As with all modpacks, they start to eat up server resources. 
	Over spring break the Mine Creeper modded server got a huge boost, we had a dedicated server. with so much more power for a short while while the 
	money lasted we opened a fully public UHC server. UHC happened the at night on friday and lasted 24 hours. afterwards the server was down and rebooted
	for the following week. When the cash ran out so did the server. we went back to how it was before. The server was so bad we all decided to restart playing 
	the Crackpack Red vs Blue Team warfare! After that we played Terrafirmacraft for a few week before playing another pack by Mowmaster. This pack was once
	 again full of tech and magic but much less adventure then the first. What made this one special was the Special Mobs. Twords the end of the year the server 
	 was seeing the lag problems again. At this point I no longer had the time to maintain a server and chose to stop hosting <span>minecraft</span> Servers</p>
	 <h4>2015</h4>
	 <p>In 2015 I started working on a new pack called 2015 (for the new year) Made with Mowmasters' usual flare it is full of Tech, Magic, and Adventure!<br />
	  This pack Is the first pack I have created that is Publically released, and also the first series on my youtube channel MowmasterLP</p>
